Based on the data and visualizations, here are the key insights into campaign performance:

Top-Performing Campaigns: Campaigns such as Campaign A and Campaign B have consistently shown higher total spend and total conversions, indicating they are effectively reaching the target audience.
These campaigns also demonstrate a high Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), suggesting efficient utilization of marketing budgets.

Channel Performance: Google Ads and Facebook Ads channels have the highest ROAS, indicating they generate significant returns for the investment.
Instagram, while popular, has lower ROAS, potentially due to higher costs or lower conversion rates.

Decreasing Performance: Some campaigns (e.g., Campaign D) show a decline in performance during the last two weeks of the analysis period, with noticeable drops in both spend and conversions. This could indicate fatigue or decreased audience engagement.

Daily Trends: The daily trends reveal seasonal or periodic spikes in spend and conversions, aligning with promotional activities or other external factors.
Certain days consistently yield lower conversions despite regular spend, suggesting inefficiencies in targeting or content.
Budget Allocation Imbalance:

Campaigns with high conversions are receiving proportionate budgets, but some campaigns with poor performance are overspending without delivering sufficient returns.
